                <h4>PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE.</h4>
                <p>My biggest piece of advice at the end of the day, is to just keep going and practice as much as possible. Don't get hung up on a specific subject or getting things perfect before you decide to move on in your growth. Practicing, making mistakes, figuring them out and getting help as needed is the best way to actively learn with coding. Utilize all the resources on the internet and via Slack with the tech/SKillcrush community!</p>
